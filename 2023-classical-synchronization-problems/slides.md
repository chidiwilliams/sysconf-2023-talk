# Introduction

- Computers use concurrency to run multiple applications at the time.
- Without concurrency, the system has to wait for each application to complete before running the next one.
- But concurrency introduces several issues involving resource sharing and synchronization.
- We'll have a look at some "classical" concurrency problems, learning about different concurrency primitives and concepts as we go.

# Producer-consumer problem

- "Bounded buffer" problem.
- > "Consider two processes, which are called the **'producer'** and the **'consumer'** respectively. The producer is a cyclic process and each time it goes through its cycle it produces a certain portion of information, that has to be processed by the consumer. The consumer is also a cyclic process and each time it goes through its cycle, it can process the next portion of information, as has been produced by the producer ... if the two are coupled via a buffer of finite size, say _N_ portions." - _Djikstra_
- Applications in queueing, logging, stream processing systems.

<v-clicks>

The producer and consumer aren't synchronized, so they access the buffer out of its bounds and produce unpredictable behaviour.
</v-clicks>

# How do we fix this?

- The producer and consumer should not access the shared variables at the same time.
- The producer should wait when the buffer is full, and the consumer when the buffer is empty.

# Mutex

- Guarantees \[mut]ual \[ex]clusion: When a thread is accessing a shared resource, no other concurrent thread can access it.
- One implementation uses **shared memory** and an **atomic test-and-set operation**.
- To "lock" the mutex, each process tries to test-and-set a location in shared memory. But only one wins, since the operation is atomic!
- Unsuccessful processes can keep checking the flag until they can acquire it.
- CPU pre-emption is possible, so the system can do other things while a process waits for the lock.

<div v-click>
```asm
lock:
    mov al, 1           ; Load AL with the value 1 (indicating locked)
    xchg [mutex], al    ; Atomically exchange the value at 'mutex' with AL
    test al, al         ; Test if the original value in AL was 0 (lock was free)
    jnz lock            ; If it was not 0, lock was already held, so try again
    ret
```

```asm
unlock:
    mov byte [mutex], 0  ; Set the mutex back to 0 (indicating unlocked)
    ret

```

# What happens when we run this?

```txt
> gcc -fsanitize=undefined -o producer_consumer producer_consumer.c && ./producer_consumer
Wait for an item to be consumed...
Wait for an item to be consumed...
Wait for an item to be consumed...
Wait for an item to be consumed...
Wait for an item to be consumed...
Wait for an item to be consumed...

```

<v-clicks>

- We're in a **deadlock**! The producer is stuck waiting for the consumer to run but never releases the lock.
- But we can't just release the lock till we know it's safe to produce more items.
- We need each party to release the lock and regain it when its counterparty signals that it's safe to do so.

# Condition variables

<div class="flex justify-around">

```c {1-2,8,11}
pthread_cond_t can_produce;
pthread_cond_t can_consume;

void *producer() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ITEMS; i++) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    while (count == BUFFER_SIZE) {
      pthread_cond_wait(&can_produce, &mutex);
    }
    buffer[count++] = i;
    pthread_cond_signal(&can_consume);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
  }
  return NULL;
}
```

<v-clicks>

```c {5,8}
void *consumer() {
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_ITEMS; i++) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    while (count == 0) {
      pthread_cond_wait(&can_consume, &mutex);
    }
    int item = buffer[--count];
    pthread_cond_signal(&can_produce);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    printf("Consumed: %d\n", item);
  }
  return NULL;
}
```

</v-clicks>
</div>

<div v-click>

- `pthread_cond_wait` waits for its condition variable to be signalled.
- It releases its lock before waiting and tries to regain it after the signal.

# Readers-writers problem

- Many concurrent reader/writer threads trying to access a shared resource at the same time.
- No thread must access the shared resource for either reading or writing while another thread is writing.
- When a writer is writing, no readers or writers are allowed. When a reader is reading, writers must wait, but other readers can proceed.
- Applications in queueing, logging, stream processing systems as well.

---

# Writers

<div class="flex justify-around">

```c
#define NUM_WRITERS 5

sem_t rw_mutex;

void *writer(void *arg) {
  sem_wait(&rw_mutex);
  printf("Writer is writing\n");
  sem_post(&rw_mutex);
  return NULL;
}
```

```c
int main() {
  pthread_t writers[NUM_WRITERS];

  sem_init(&rw_mutex, 0, 1);

  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_WRITERS; i++) {
    pthread_create(&writers[i], NULL, writer, NULL);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_WRITERS; i++) {
    pthread_join(writers[i], NULL);
  }

  sem_destroy(&rw_mutex);

  return 0;
}

```

</div>

---

# Semaphore

- A variable that is changed (incremented/decremented, or toggled) based on some conditions.
- Used to control access to a shared resource.
- **Counting semaphores** allow arbitrary resource count; **binary semaphores** are restricted to 0 and 1 (locks).

```asm
; Increment semaphore
post:
    lock inc dword [semaphore]
    ret

; Decrement semaphore (wait if 0 or negative)
wait:
    lock dec dword [semaphore]
    js wait_busy
    ret

wait_busy:
    lock cmp dword [semaphore], 0
    jl wait_busy
    ret
```

---

# Readers

<div class="flex justify-around">

```c
sem_t mutex;
int read_count = 0;
```

```c
void *reader(void *arg) {
  // Acquire rw_mutex if this is the only reader
  sem_wait(&mutex);
  read_count++;
  if (read_count == 1) {
    sem_wait(&rw_mutex);
  }
  sem_post(&mutex);

  printf("Reader is reading\n");

  // Release rw_mutex if this is the last reader
  sem_wait(&mutex);
  read_count--;
  if (read_count == 0) {
    sem_post(&rw_mutex);
  }
  sem_post(&mutex);

  return NULL;
}
```

</div>

# Output

<div class="flex justify-around">

```txt
Writer 3 is writing
Writer 3 finished writing
Reader 3 is reading
Reader 1 is reading
Reader 2 is reading
Reader 0 is reading
Reader 4 is reading
Reader 3 finished reading
Reader 1 finished reading
Reader 2 finished reading
Reader 4 finished reading
Reader 0 finished reading
Writer 4 is writing
Writer 4 finished writing
Writer 1 is writing
Writer 1 finished writing
Writer 0 is writing
Writer 0 finished writing
Writer 2 is writing
Writer 2 finished writing
```

<div>

Notice how:

- Once a writer starts, no writer/reader can start.
- Multiple readers can start reading at the same time.
- All readers have to complete before writing restarts.
